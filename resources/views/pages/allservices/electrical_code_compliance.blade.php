            <h3>Is Barin Electrical Insured And Licensed With Electrical Code Compliance?
            </h3>
            <p>Yes! Our residential and commercial electrical services are fully insured and licensed in the State of
                California (License #1024365). This means that we go the extra mile to comply with local and state
                regulations, and weâ€™re also regularly educated on updates and the latest developments in the energy
                industry. The value of a licensed electrician is that the industry requires 2,000 hours of work in a
                three year period and 32 hours of continuing education to renew a license. This means that we make an
                effort to stay current with the State of California Department of Industrial Relations.</p>
