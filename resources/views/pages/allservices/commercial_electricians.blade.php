                        <p>New commercial constructions are different than residential constructions with coding and the
                            scope of versatility an electrical system may need to have for a commercial building. Our
                            goal is to work with your other contractors and understand their long-term electrical needs
                            to best setup the electric panels, circuits, wiring, and capabilities from the beginning.
                            Our electrical contractors know your investment is important, and mistakes cost money. We
                            focus on commercial electrical services that are safe, follow code, and offer the best
                            modern energy efficient potential for your new commercial construction.

                            installation. This helps everyone involved in a commercial project to visualize the impacts
                            of an upgrade, retrofit, repair, or construction. Commercial wiring carries more power than
                            a residential project, including 480 and 600 volts. Our goal is to optimize your business’
                            electrical design.</p>

                            <p>Electrical upgrades are a fantastic marketing tool for any business today. “Going green”
                                and being “Earth-friendly” can radically impact your customer base targets, and many
                                businesses in Los Angeles need an electrical contractor with the ability to do energy
                                efficient upgrades and retrofits in their commercial properties. While older buildings
                                present some caution due to older internal structures, our team of electricians is
                                experienced in updating wiring and making sure overloads are avoided, making your
                                business investment a smart decision in the long-term.</p>

                        <p>Proper commercial switchboard installation avoids costly interruptions. It’s clear that any
                            outdated switchboards pose a fire hazard, but more common these days is a loss of
                            electricity and a loss of income due to the power outage. We help our commercial clients
                            prepare for these outages and to maintain equipment over the years, too. We make sure that
                            your current switchboard is able to handle the current energy demands, but we also upgrade
                            and replace old switchboards when needed.</p>
