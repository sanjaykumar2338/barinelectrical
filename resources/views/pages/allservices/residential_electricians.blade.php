                        <p>Installing an electrical system or a generator requires a residential electrician with the
                            ability to make safe decisions for your specific home. Sometimes you see someone else’s home
                            ideas and think they can be done the same way on your property, but all homes are different.
                            We ensure that installations are done by following electrical code compliant guidelines and
                            sharing our professional opinion about your installation plans.</p>

                            <p>There are so many different kinds of residential electrical repairs these days. From a
                                minor light flicker in your kitchen to a buzzing sound coming from an outlet, we handle
                                it all. If circuit breakers keep failing or you smell something burning and cannot
                                identify it, it is time for an electrical repair. It’s amazing how people will wait
                                until they feel a small shock or see a spark before calling a residential electrician to
                                check out the problem. Don’t wait!</p>

                        <p>A new construction for your home can be exciting and nerve-wrecking, all at the same time.
                            It’s difficult to place your full attention on only one aspect of the home’s design and
                            structure. Different members of your contracting team will want your input, opinion, and
                            approval throughout the entire process. Our electricians understand that when it comes to
                            electricity, you just want to know it’ll be done safely, by code, and with the most recent
                            options at your disposal. We know everyone has a different idea about what is their “dream
                            home,” but one thing all of those dream homes have in common is that everyone wants to feel
                            safe in their own home at the end of the day.</p>

                            environmentally-friendly options in their homes. Sometimes upgrades must be done over time,

                            the structural changes for additions and remodels. Renovations often require rewiring of old
                            homes with substandard or outdated wiring. Since these are considered fire hazards, it is
                            important to consider all elements of a home addition, remodeling, or complete renovation.
                            If you want to add circuits to your home structure, trust our residential electricians to
                            give you the best advice on how to prevent overloading circuit breakers and accomplishing
